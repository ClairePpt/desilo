You are signed up to observe for DESI as a Data Quality Scientist (DQS). Thank you for participating in our observing program!<br> 
<br>
Your shift will start approximately 30 minutes prior to 12 degree twilight, which is about 7pm MST now. The start of your shift is designed to allow you to
review the late afternoon calibration frames. Prior to this, we have the Afternoon Planning Meeting at 4pm MST. You are welcome to join this meeting, but if due
to time zone challenges, it is not required. If you don’t intend attend the 4pm meeting, please let us know and then make sure to review the night’s plan with
the Lead Observer (LO) when you start your shift.<br>
<br>
You will use this Zoom channel to connect to the afternoon meeting and throughout the night observing:

Before starting your observing shift, please review the <a
href="https://desi.lbl.gov/DocDB/cgi-bin/private/ShowDocument?docid=4224">DESI Code of Conduct</a>. You will be interacting with both NOIRLab
staff and DESI Collaboration members during your shift, please act with respect.<br>
<br>
If this is your first time observing for DESI and/or would like to learn more about the instrument, the <a
href="https://desi.lbl.gov/trac/wiki/DESIOperations/ObserverHandbook">Observer’s Handbook</a> is a good
place to start.<br>
<br>
DESI is a complex instrument and we want the observing to proceed smoothly and efficiently. As the DQS, you will be responsible for:
<ul>
<li>Reviewing the calibrations to ensure that there are no problems</li>
<li>Monitoring the quality of the data frames </li>
<li>Contributing information regarding the data to the nightly log</li>
<li>Helping the Lead Observing Scientist and Observing Scientist if needed</li>
</ul>
<br>
In preparation for your upcoming shift, please review the following documentation: 
<ul>
<li><a href="https://desi.lbl.gov/trac/wiki/DESIOperations/RemoteObserving">Remote Observing Preparation Page</a>. Confirm that you are able to connect to all
tools you will need for observing.</li>
<li>The home page for DESI operations is here: https://desi.lbl.gov/trac/wiki/DESIOperations.  Please review the Daily Routine section.</li>
<li>Your responsibilities and the tools required to effectively complete those responsibilities are detailed on this page:
https://desi.lbl.gov/trac/wiki/DESIOperations/ObserverDQ </li>
<li>Please review carefully all the items, especially the ones related to  <a href="https://desi.lbl.gov/trac/wiki/DESIOperations/NightWatch">Nightwatch</a>, the
tool used to examine the
data.</li> 
<ul>
<li>You should already have access to connect to <a ref="https://nightwatch.desi.lbl.gov/nights.html">Nightwatch through NERSC</a>. If you have access
issues, instructions are <a href="https://desi.lbl.gov/trac/wiki/Computing/AccessNerscData">here</a> </li> </ul>
<li>Since you will contribute to the Night Log, please review the instructions <a
href="https://desi.lbl.gov/trac/wiki/DESIOperations/NightLog">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<br>
Please let us know in advance if you have any questions. It might be helpful for you to participate as an “observer” on a night prior
to your run. If you would like to do so, please let us know and we can set this up as needed. It is also useful to start attending the
daily 4pm MST planning meeting one night before the start of your actual shift <br>
<br>
We thank you for helping us with the DESI observing. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions.<br>
