You are signed up to observe for DESI as a Data Quality Scientist (DQS). Thank you for participating in our observing program!<br> 
<br>
Your shift will start approximately 30 minutes prior to 12 degree twilight (find Kitt Peak ephemeris <a href="https://www.noao.edu/kpno/skycal/cal2021.html">here</a>). The start of your shift is designed to allow you time to review the late afternoon calibration frames. Prior to this, we have the Afternoon Planning Meeting at 4pm MST. You are welcome to join this meeting, but if due to time zone challenges, it is not required. If you don’t intend attend the 4pm meeting, please let us know and then make sure to review the night’s plan with
the Lead Observer (LO) when you start your shift.<br>
<br>
You will use this Zoom channel to connect to the afternoon meeting and throughout the night observing:

Before starting your observing shift, please review the <a
href="https://desi.lbl.gov/DocDB/cgi-bin/private/ShowDocument?docid=4224">DESI Code of Conduct</a>. You will be interacting with both NOIRLab staff and DESI Collaboration members during your shift, please act with respect.<br>
<br>
DESI is a complex instrument and we want the observing to proceed smoothly and efficiently. As the DQS, you will be responsible for:
<ul>
<li>Reviewing the calibrations to ensure that there are no problems</li>
<li>Monitoring the quality of the data frames </li>
<li>Contributing information regarding the data to the nightly log</li>
<li>Helping the Lead Observing Scientist and Observing Scientist if needed</li>
</ul>
<br>
In preparation for your upcoming shift, please review the all materials relevant to the DQS on the <a href="https://desi.lbl.gov/trac/wiki/DESIOperations/NewObserverTraining">Observer Training wiki page</a>. The day prior to your shift you will receive a reminder email with a pre-observing checklist. By that time you will be expected to have reviewed all training materials.<br>
<br>
Please let us know in advance if you have any questions. It might be helpful for you to participate in observing for a couple hours on a night prior to your run. If you would like to do so, please let us know and we can set this up as needed. It is also useful to start attending the daily 4pm MST planning meeting one night before the start of your actual shift <br>
<br>
We thank you for helping us with the DESI observing. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions.<br>
