This email is to confirm that you signed up for an observing shift for DESI during the 2022A semester starting on the date listed above. Thank you! We look forward to working with you.<br>
<br>
If your plans change and you will not be able to complete your shift as schedule, please work with others at your institution to cover your shift. If you cannot find anything to cover your shift, we can help you find a replacement from the collaboration. In either case, please keep us informed of any changes.<br>
<br>
Please add your shift to your calendar. We will send you reminders, but itâ€™s best to plan ahead. You will receive a reminder email one month in advance of your shift. Then, 2 weeks before your observing shift, you will be sent instructions on where to find important documentation and required training. In the meantime, you can start reviewing documentation on the DESI wiki here: https://desi.lbl.gov/trac/wiki/DESIOperations.<br>
