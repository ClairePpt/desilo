You are signed up to observe for DESI as an Support Observing Scientist (SO). Thank you for participating in our observing program!<br> 
<br>
If you are signed up for the first SO shift, your observing shift will begin with the Afternoon Planning meeting at 4pm MST. Following the 4pm meeting, you will be responsible for starting the Afternoon Spectrograph Calibrations. Those will likely start at 5:15pm MST. Your Lead Observer will tell you when to sign on for the night observing, approximately 30 minutes prior to 12 degree twilight (find Kitt Peak ephemeris <a href="https://www.noao.edu/kpno/skycal/cal2021.html">here</a>). Your shift will run until 12:15am MST.<br>
<br>
If you are signed up for the second SO shift, your observing night will begin at 11:45pm MST and run until observing ends, at
approximately 12 degree twilight.<br>
<br>
You will use this Zoom channel to connect to the afternoon meeting and connect with the observing team throughout the night:

<br>
Before starting your observing shift, please review the <a
href="https://desi.lbl.gov/DocDB/cgi-bin/private/ShowDocument?docid=4224">DESI Code of Conduct</a>. You will be interacting with both NOIRLab staff and DESI Collaboration members during your shift; please act with respect.<br>
<br>
DESI is a complex instrument and we want the observing to proceed smoothly and efficiently. As the SO, you will be responsible for:
<ul>
<li>Complete QA on each exposure using Nightwatch and enter into NightLog</li>
<li>Monitor and evaluate environmental conditions and instrument performance</li>
<li>Inspect the GFA and FVC imaging periodically through the night</li>
<li>Running <a

</ul>
<br>
In preparation for your upcoming shift, please review the all materials relevant to the SO on the <a href="https://desi.lbl.gov/trac/wiki/DESIOperations/NewObserverTraining">Observer Training wiki page</a>. The day prior to your shift you will receive a reminder email with a pre-observing checklist. By that time you will be expected to have reviewed all training materials.<br>
<br>
Please let us know in advance if you have any questions. It might be helpful for you to participate in observing for a couple hours on a night prior to your run. If you would like to do so, please let us know and we can set this up as needed. It is also useful to start attending the daily 4pm MST planning meeting one night before the start of your actual shift <br>
<br>
We thank you for helping us with the DESI observing. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions.<br>
