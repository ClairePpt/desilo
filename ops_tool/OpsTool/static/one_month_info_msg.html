<br>
You have signed up for an observing shift for DESI starting on the date above. Thank you! We look forward to working with you.<br>
<br>
Please add your shift to your calendar. We will send you reminders, but it's best to plan ahead. <br>
<br>
If your plans change and you will not be able to complete your shift, please work with others at your institution to cover your shift. If you cannot find anyone to cover the shift, we can help you find someone from the collaboration to fill the shift. Please keep us informed of any changes. <br>
<br>
You will receive instructions about 2 weeks before your observing shift on where to find important documentation and training you will need to complete before your shift. In the meantime, start reviewing the documentation on the DESI wiki here: https://desi.lbl.gov/trac/wiki/DESIOperations. <br>
<br>
Please contact us with any questions or concerns!<br>
