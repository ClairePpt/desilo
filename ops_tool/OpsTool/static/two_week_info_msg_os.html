You are signed up to observe for DESI as an Observing Scientist (OS). Thank you for participating in our observing program!<br> 
<br>
If you are signed up for the first OS shift, your observing shift will begin with the Afternoon Planning meeting at 4pm MST. Following
the 4pm meeting, you will be responsible for starting the Afternoon Spectrograph Calibrations. Those will likely start at 5:15pm MST.
Your Lead Observer will tell you when to sign on for the night observing, which will likely be around 7pm MST. Your shift will run
until 12:15am MST.<br>
<br>
If you are signed up for the second OS shift you observing shift will begin at 11:45pm MST and run until observing ends, at
approximately 12 degree twilight.<br>
<br>
You will use this Zoom channel to connect to the afternoon meeting and throughout the night observing:

<br>
Before starting your observing shift, please review the <a
href="https://desi.lbl.gov/DocDB/cgi-bin/private/ShowDocument?docid=4224">DESI Code of Conduct</a>. You will be interacting with both NOIRLab
staff and DESI Collaboration members during your shift, please act with respect.<br>
<br>
If this is your first time observing for DESI and/or would like to learn more about the instrument, the <a
href="https://desi.lbl.gov/trac/wiki/DESIOperations/ObserverHandbook">Observer’s Handbook</a> is a good
place to start.<br>
<br>
DESI is a complex instrument and we want the observing to proceed smoothly and efficiently. As the OS, you will be responsible for:
<ul>
<li>monitoring the progress of observing</li>
<li>monitoring the weather conditions and image quality</li>
<li>writing the nightly log (and recording the observing, observing conditions, and any problems)</li>
<li>helping the Lead Observing Scientist (LOS) monitor the telemetry from the instrument.</li>
<li>The first OS observer will be responsible for running <a
href="https://desi.lbl.gov/trac/wiki/DESIOperations/Calibrations#AfternoonCalibrations">Spectrograph Calibrations</a> following the Afternoon Meeting.</li>
</ul>
<br>
In preparation for your upcoming shift, please review the following documentation: 
<ul>
<li><a href="https://desi.lbl.gov/trac/wiki/DESIOperations/RemoteObserving">Remote Observing Preparation Page</a>. Confirm that you are able to connect to all
tools you will need for observing.</li>
<li>The home page for DESI operations is here: https://desi.lbl.gov/trac/wiki/DESIOperations.  Please review the Daily Routine section.</li>
<li>Your responsibilities and the tools required to effectively complete those responsibilities are detailed on this page:
https://desi.lbl.gov/trac/wiki/DESIOperations/ObserverSci </li>
<li>Since you will be in charge of the night log, please review the instructions <a
href="https://desi.lbl.gov/trac/wiki/DESIOperations/NightLog">here</a>.</li>
<li>It is also useful to know how to use <a href="https://desi.lbl.gov/trac/wiki/DESIOperations/NightWatch">Nightwatch</a>, the tool used to examine the
data.</li> 
</ul>
<br>
Please let us know in advance if you have any questions. It might be helpful for you to participate as an “observer” on a night prior
to your run. If you would like to do so, please let us know and we can set this up as needed. It is also useful to start attending the
daily 4pm MST planning meeting one night before the start of your actual shift <br>
<br>
We thank you for helping us with the DESI observing. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions.<br>
<br>
Best regards,<br> 
Parker and Arjun<br>
The DESI Observing Operations Team<br>
